## Api

The API is an ASP NET WebApi project, which takes advantage of Mediatr and FluentValidation packages to provide clean vertical slices for all features (Create, Read, Update and Delete). These can be accessed via Swagger

## Ui

The Ui is an ASP NET WebApp project. All of my changes are found within the index.cshtml page. It currently implements Create, Read (with pagination), and Delete functionality.
